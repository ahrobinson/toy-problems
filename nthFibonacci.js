/*
Suppose a newly-born pair of iguanas, one male, one female, are put in a large aquarium.

Iguanas are able to mate at the age of one month so that at
the end of its second month a female can produce another pair of iguanas.

Suppose that our iguanas never die and that the female always
produces one new pair (one male, one female) every month from the second month on.

How many pairs of iguanas will there be after n months?

For example, the iguana pair size for months zero through five are:

0 1 1 2 3 5
If n were 4, your function should return 3; for 5, it should return 5.

HINT: This iguana pattern is described exactly by the fibonacci sequence:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number

Write a function that accepts a number n and returns the number of
iguana pairs after n months.

DO NOT use a recursive solution to this problem. Your solution run in linear time.

nthFibonacci = function(n) {
  var arr = [0,1]

    return n
  }
  for(var i = 2; i <= n; i++){
    arr[i] = arr[i-1] + arr[i-2]
  }
  return arr[arr.length-1]
};
